# BATTLESHIP

A full-featured, single-player Battleship game built with React 19, TypeScript 5.9, and Vite 6. Play against four AI difficulty tiers — from erratic random fire to a near-optimal probability-density engine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20 or later ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- **npm** 9 or later (bundled with Node)

Verify your versions:

```bash
node -v   # should print v20.x.x or higher
npm -v    # should print 9.x.x or higher
```

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/battleship.git
cd battleship

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a dev server at **http://localhost:3000** and open your browser automatically. Hot module replacement is enabled — edits to any source file reflect instantly.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite (≈ 1 000 tests across 19 files)
npm test

# Watch mode — re-runs affected tests on save
npm run test:watch
```

Tests use Jest 30 with ts-jest and jsdom. No browser required.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output lands in `dist/`. To preview the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
# Opens http://localhost:4173
```

## AI Difficulty Tiers

| Tier   | Codename  | Strategy                                                                 |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy   | ERRATIC   | Pure random fire. Never enters target mode after a hit.                  |
| Medium | HUNTER    | Checkerboard hunt pattern. Converges on hits with axis-backtrack logic.  |
| Hard   | PREDATOR  | Density-weighted hunt biased toward the largest remaining ship.          |
| Sweaty | ORACLE    | Full probability density across all remaining ships. Near-optimal.       |

All tiers above Easy share the same multi-ship tracking system (Option 3): if the AI hits two ships simultaneously it will never abandon a confirmed hit even after sinking an adjacent vessel.

---

## Scoring System

Scoring is based on **player shots only** (AI attacks do not count against you).

```
score = floor( 17 / player_shots_fired × 100 )  clamped to [0, 100]
```

| Score | Rank                  |
|-------|-----------------------|
| 100   | General of the Armies |
| 90–99 | Admiral               |
| 69–89 | Captain               |
| 36–68 | Sergeant              |
| 0–35  | Private               |

A perfect game — sinking all 17 ship cells in exactly 17 shots — scores 100%.
